  <p> <i> Every organism needs energy to carry on with the process of living which comes from food. Food usually comes from
  animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that
  people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans.
  
  It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are
  often called "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.
  Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people
  refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called
  vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism. </i></p>
